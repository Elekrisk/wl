WL is a stack-based language.

A series of digits is pushed as an integer to the stack.
A series of characters surrounded by "" is pushed as a string to the stack with escape sequences.
A series of characters surrounded by {} is pushed as a string to the stack without escape sequences.
  This allows nested strings.
A series of letters are evaluated as a global variable and pushed to the stack.

Commands:
+   (a, b) -> c         c = a + b
-   (a:i, b:i) -> c:i   c = a - b
*   (a, b:i) -> c       c = a * b
/   (a:i, b:i) -> c:i   c = a / b
!   (code:s) -> ?
    Executes `code` as WL code, sharing stack.
@   (a:a, n:i) -> (a, a[n])
    The n-th value of the array `a` is removed from `a`, and `a` and the item are pushed to the
    stack, in that order. Negative indices are counted from the end of the array.
#   (code:s, n:i) -> ?
    If `n` is above zero, `code` is executed that amount of times. Before each execution,
    the iteration number is pushed to the stack, starting at 0.
$   (a, b) -> (b, a)
%   a -> (a, a)         deep copy
[   () -> a:a
    Creates and pushes an empty array.
?   (t:s, f:s, c:i) -> ?
    If `c` is nonzero, `t` is executed, else, `f` is.
;   (a) -> ()
:   (a:a) -> a, l:i
    Returns a and it's length
=   (a, b) -> c:i
    Checks whether a and b are structurally equal, 1 = true, 0 = false
